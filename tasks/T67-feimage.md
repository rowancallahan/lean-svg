# T67 — feImage (same-document references)  (branch `claude/feat-feimage`)

The filter foundation (T51, read `tasks/T51-filters.md` and `DESIGN.md`
§3.11 first) has landed. Adding a primitive is: a `Kind` constructor, a clause
in `Filter.convertPrim`, a case in `FilterApply.runPrim`, and removing its name
from `Filter.isKnownUnsupported`. **Other agents are adding other primitives
concurrently**, so: put all of your primitive's code in a new file
`LeanSvg/Filter/<Name>.lean` (imported where needed), and keep your edits to
`Filter.lean`/`FilterApply.lean` to those few one-line-ish additions. Match
resvg 0.48.1's `crates/resvg/src/filter/*.rs` exactly where pixels depend on
it (its f32 maths must be reproduced in fixed point/integers to within the
8-level tolerance; exact is better — T51's report shows how it matched
colour-space LUTs and f32 sin/cos). Respect T51's work budgets: every
per-pixel loop is bounded by the layer area times a constant or a bounded
kernel size; cap kernel sizes/octaves/etc. as resvg does, and add an
adversarial case for the expensive parameter.

Target: `filters/feImage` (26 failing). Scope for now: `href` to an element
**in the same document** (usvg renders that element, with its own
transform, into the primitive subregion — see usvg `parser/filter.rs`
`convert_image` and resvg `filter/mod.rs` `apply_image`), and
`preserveAspectRatio`. `href` with a `data:` image: another agent (T63) is
building `<image>` and the decoders behind `LeanSvg/ImageData.lean`; call
`ImageData`-level decoding only through a function T63 will expose — for now
treat `data:` hrefs as usvg treats an image it cannot decode, and leave a
clearly marked single call site so the integrator can wire it up. Any other
href (file, URL): nothing is loaded, same as unsupported. Rendering the
referenced element needs the renderer's node walk: reuse
`Render.renderNodes` (it is re-entrant; masks use it the same way) with the
fuel it is given, and count it in the existing budgets.

## Common rules (every lean-svg agent)

You are one of ~15 agents working in parallel on lean-svg, a total, float-free
SVG→PNG renderer in Lean 4 whose output is compared against resvg 0.48.1.
An integrator merges all branches afterwards, so **keep your diff small and
local**: prefer new functions/new modules (`LeanSvg/<Feature>.lean`, imported
from `LeanSvg.lean`) over rewriting shared code in `Svg.lean` / `Render.lean`.
No drive-by refactors, renames or reformatting of code you do not need.

**Setup (first thing):** `bash scripts/cloud-setup.sh` then
`export PATH=$HOME/.elan/bin:$PATH`. It installs Lean from the GitHub release,
resvg/usvg 0.48.1, numpy/pillow and the resvg test suite under
`tests/corpora/resvg-test-suite`, and builds. Read `tasks/README.md`,
`DESIGN.md` and the relevant parts of `SPEC.md` before editing.

**Invariants (hard, from tasks/README.md):** no `partial`, `unsafe`,
`@[extern]`, `panic!`, `!`-indexing, `Float`; loops over finite ranges or
structurally decreasing fuel; hot loops in `Nat`; no new build warnings;
`LeanSvg/Effect.lean` untouched unless your task is about it; no IO outside
`Effect.lean`. Code should fail loudly rather than silently: prefer
rejecting/asserting over swallowing errors, but a feature that is not
supported should degrade exactly as it does today (skip), not error.

**Reference behaviour:** match resvg/usvg 0.48.1. The Rust source is the spec
(`git clone --depth 1 --branch v0.48.1 https://github.com/linebender/resvg`
into a scratch dir; `crates/usvg/src/parser/*` and `crates/resvg/src/*`).

**Baseline first, before any edit:**
```
python3 tests/run_corpora.py --fast --corpus resvg --route direct --out /tmp/base --no-worst
python3 tests/run_tests.py
```

**Verification before you push (all must hold):**
1. `lake build` — no errors, no new warnings.
2. `bash scripts/check-theorems.sh` prints `theorems ok`. Note
   `proofs/SizeBound.lean` reasons about `render`; if your change breaks it,
   fix the proof, do not delete or weaken it.
3. Full corpus with delta table:
   `python3 tests/run_corpora.py --fast --corpus resvg --route direct --out /tmp/after --no-worst --compare /tmp/base/resvg_direct.csv`
   **Zero files may go from pass to fail.** Investigate any file whose
   within-8 score drops.
4. `python3 tests/run_tests.py` — no file's score drops; `python3 tests/run_adversarial.py` all clean;
   `python3 tests/run_tiles.py` byte-identical.
5. Add at least one small `tests/svg/NN_<feature>.svg` exercising the feature
   if it fits the local corpus style (pick an unused number; collisions with
   other agents are resolved by the integrator).

**Deliverable:** write `tasks/<ID>-<slug>.md` (the ID given below) with the
spec you implemented, what you skipped and why, and a `## Report` with the
before/after numbers for your target directories and the whole suite.
Commit (author `Rowan Callahan <rowan.l.callahan@gmail.com>`) in logical
commits and push to your assigned branch. **Do not open a pull request, do not
merge, do not push to any other branch.** If you run out of time, push what
is verified-clean and document what remains. Aim to finish within a few
hours; partial but regression-free beats complete but risky.
